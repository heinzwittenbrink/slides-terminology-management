# Terminology Management

##

![](https://thecontentwrangler.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2016-02-15-15.09.52-995x640.png)

## Terminology related problems


## Inconsistent and inaccurate content

Cause of

* customer confusion
* regulatory compliance challenges
* law suits


## Translation and localization issues

(addressed after completion of content creation process)

Cause of

* unnecessary translation and localization challenges and expenses

## Struggling with content review process slow downs

Cause of

* time-to-market delays

## insufficient time to do a thorough review

Cause of

* content quality problems

## "Language Aftherthought Syndrome"

> A pattern of treating language requirements as secondary considerations within content strategies and solutions

## Terminology management as key component

> Every content strategy should include terminology management as a key component. The overarching goal is to ensure the efficient creation of effective, top quality content

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]

## Content quality management

> Implementing a content strategy that makes content quality a key success factor from the start involves ensuring quality management principles are built into your content lifecycle from beginning to end.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]


## Processes (content operations)

> Strategically managing terminology also requires you to put in place processes that enforce your rules by guiding authors in the creation of high-quality, consistent, unambiguous content.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]


## Problems to prevent

* polysemous ambiguous terms
* industry jargon
* transient terms
* various metaphors and analogies (Americanisms, for example)
* unapproved terms, phrases, sentences words,
* concepts that are difficult or impossible to translate

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]



## Requirements/tools

* standardized terminology (your official vocabulary)
* a terminology database (a repository for your terms)
* style, branding, and authoring guidelines (your content rules)
* appropriately sized editorial staff/software application/appropriate combination of automation and editorial staff

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]

## Automation of terminology management

>  And yet, depending on their background, experience, and their view of what is important to customers, some content strategists may not see anything wrong with managing terminology manually.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]

## Style guides

> The most common assistance offered to content authors (to prevent them from making mistakes that later will need to be edited) is the style guide.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]


# Acrolinx

## Status for terms

> With terminology, you give a status to a term and allow only one to be used. In this case, you can say that "email" is the preferred term, and "email message" and "electronic mail" are deprecated terms.

## Sidebar: Training

[Get to know the Acrolinx Sidebar - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFq5EP54a5M "Get to know the Acrolinx Sidebar - YouTube")

## Sidebar as tool for authors

> Writers get feedback on terminology in the Acrolinx Sidebar. They can see which terms to avoid, and if there’s a linked preferred term, they see a suggestion for the term to use instead.

[@WhatTerminologyCore]



## Context sensitivity

> Acrolinx allows the company to specify different rules for different lines of business, while still maintaining centralized control over corporate terminology.

# Case Study: IBM


## Problem at scale: Editorial quality

> editors, for example, spent 30-50% of their time attempting to catch errors in style, grammar, and branding. And yet, errors and other content problems proliferated.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]

## Optimization of authoring processes

> When IBM took a closer look, it realized that the authoring processes utilized were not optimized for success. A content audit revealed that in some cases, authors created many different ways to say the same thing.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]


## Optimizing content operations

> the company increasingly improved its content creation, management and delivery methods, it soon realized that traditional approaches to controlling content quality failed to help them meet their goals

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]


## Software supporting authoring processes

> IBM evaluated a variety of potential solutions, settling on Acrolinx, a suite of information quality tools designed by language experts and artificial intelligence researchers.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]

## Acrolinx approach

> ... support of content quality as a corporate goal ... creating an enterprise terminology management system and linguistic rules designed to ensure consistency and promote the creation of quality content across the enterprise.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]

## Support of authoring tools

> Acrolinx was attractive to IBM for a variety of reasons, including its support for a wide variety of authoring tools including Microsoft Word, Adobe FrameMaker, XMetaL, Arbortext, Oxygen, Lotus Notes — even PowerPoint.

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]


## "Linguistic superpowers" (Scott Abel")

> The software makes it possible for organizations to programmatically help authors avoid making grammar, punctuation, spelling and style errors. it also helps them avoid violating terminology usage rules, and corporate style, branding and authoring guidelines

[@abelTerminologyManagementCritical2016]


## Measurement of success

> Over a six month period, IBM reports that Acrolinx flagged over 2.5 million problems that authors fixed during the content creation process, saving the company thousands of hours of manual editing labor. The most common errors were terminology and style.
